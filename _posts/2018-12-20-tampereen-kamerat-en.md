The Finnish Transport Agency has interrupted distribution of traffic and weather camera images from the Tampere city streets in the Digitraffic service. 

The distribution was interrupted because images from the streets may include personal data, e.g. register plates of vehicles those can't be shared as open data.
Images from 25 cameras in Tampere were shared in the Digitraffic service. Distribution of images originating from the cameras of the Finnish Transport Agency continues normally. Images from over 600 weather and traffic cameras are still availabkle in real time.
