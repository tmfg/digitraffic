On the [Digitraffic status page](https://status.digitraffic.fi/), users can
see status of API endpoints and subscribe to ATOM feed for notices regarding service disruptions and
maintenance breaks. We will also be notifying about API
sunsets via the status page and in [API changes](/en/support/api-changes/) page.

Open developer communities form the support channel for the Digitraffic service.
The communities operate on open Google discussion groups where all discussion is
public. The specialists from Fintraffic and the service supplier for the
Digitraffic service are involved in the communities. The discussion groups are
also used to announce new API features.
